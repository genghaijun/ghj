\section{Performance Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

Since our main motivation is to achieve good computational efficiency and LFA coverage,
we compare IAC with TBFH, DMPA, and the naive method that uses $k$ SPT.
Table \ref{britetable1} lists their LFA capabilities with respect to each criterion,
where $full$ means the corresponding algorithm can compute all alternate next hops
that satisfy the LFA criterion in the column header, $partial$ means only a subset
of alternate next hops for the criterion can be computed, while $-$ means the algorithm
cannot be used for that criterion.

\end{table}

As shown in table \ref{britetable1}, only IAC can be applied to three LFA rules and can compute all the next hops  that meet the LFA rule. The other three algorithms do not support NPC rule.
Both of the DMPA and TBFH  can be  used to deal with LFC and DC rule. However  DMPA and TBFH cannot compute all the next hops which satisfied LFC and DC rules.




Evaluation studies \cite{Gjoka2007Evaluation,Menth20101300} show that LFA protects against
many more failures than ECMP. Nevertheless, they also reveal that, on
average, LFA offers protection against only about 50\%
of all possible link failures and less than 40\% of node failures
Despite the limited protection it achieves, LFA is already supported by some equipment vendors \cite{cisco,Juniper}. With that in mind,
Retvari et al. \cite{lfarevisited} suggested that networks should be augmented with additional links to ensure that LFA can provide recovery
for all possible failures.
Therefore, our algorithms can directly use the above research findings, so that they can protect all single network component failure scenarios in the network.

To evaluate our algorithms,
we use the real  network
CERNET2 (14 nodes, 16 links), Abilene (11 nodes, 14 links), NJLATA (11 nodes, 23 links), TORONTO (25 nodes, 55 links) and
USLD (28 nodes, 45 links)
and five ISP topologies which are measured by Rocketfuel\cite{2004148100061},
including   AS1221 (108 nodes, 153 links),
AS1239 (315 nodes, 972 links),
AS1755 (87 nodes, 161 links), AS3257 (161 nodes, 328 links),
AS3967 (79 nodes, 147 links), and AS6461  (128 nodes, 372 links) .
We also generate synthetic topologies with BRITE \cite{medina2001brite}.
The model is set to Waxman, mode is set to be Router only. The bandwidth
on each link follows a heavy-tail distribution ranging from
100 to 1024 \cite {Gjoka2007Evaluation} and the link cost is an inverse function of the bandwidth. 
The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are set to 0.5.
%using parameters as listed in Table \ref{britetable}.
%In this section, we first show how link failures are modeled in our evaluation.
For similarity, we use a simple model to characterize link failure events.
The fail probability of each link $e$
is randomly generated in the range from 0 to 0.001.
All the simulations are conducted on a PC with Intel
i5 CPU, 1.7GHz and 1.5G Memory.
\iffalse
Due to space
constraints, we only present the results
for DC rule in the experiment, while the results for LFC and NPC
are similar.
\fi
%Because neither DMPA nor TBFH can implement the NPC rule,  so in the experiment we only compare the performance of the four methods on achieving  DC rule.

%Due to space constraints, we only list data for DC rules.

Theoretical analysis has indicated that the time complexity of IAC is less than that of building of a shortest path tree, which has a great advantage over Naive, TBFH and DMPA.\fi
In order to verify the computational performance, we make simulations on different topologies. In this section, we evaluate the computational overhead of different algorithms. In order to avoid the uncertain factors impact the algorithm’s performance. The computational overhead of an algorithm is defined as the ratio of computation time of the algorithm to that of SPF (shortest path first).

Fig. \ref{nodedegree6} presents the relationship between the computation overhead and average node degree on generated topologies when the topology size is 200.
As the average node degree increases, the computation overhead of Naive increases accordingly. And also IAC has the highest performance among all the algorithms. Therefore, the above experiment results are consistent with the theoretical analysis described above.

Fig. \ref{realtopologytime} indicates the computational overhead obtained by different algorithms on real and Rocketfuel topologies. From the Fig. \ref{realtopologytime}, we can see that IAC has the lowest computation overhead among all the algorithms. The computation overhead of IAC is less than computing a SPT, while DMPA need to construct a SPT and TBFH need to compute two SPTs. The computation overhead of Naive is proportionally to the average node degree of the network.

\subsection{Protection ratio and the cumulative distribution of the
number of backup next hops}
In this section, we will use the protection ratio  and the average number of backup next hops to measure the path diversity of different algorithms.
The protection ratio is defined as
\begin{equation}
Pr=\frac{\sum\limits_{c,d\in V, c\neq d}{K(c,d)}}{|V|*(|V|-1)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K(c,d)=\begin{cases}
1&\mbox{$|N_c(d)|\geq 2$}\\
0&\mbox{$|N_c(d)|=1$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The average number of backup next hops
describes the number of opportunities packets can be deflected off the
shortest path.
For both of the above two metrics, larger is better.

Fig. \ref{prd} presents the relationship between the protection ratio and average node degree on generated topologies
when the topology size is 200.
Fig. \ref{prreal} depicts the protection ratio obtained by different algorithms on real and measured topologies.
Fig. \ref{generatenumber} shows the average number of backup next hops obtained by different algorithms on generated topologies.

We made several conclusions. First, IAC is more
flexible than TBFH and DMPA. It has more deflection choices in all
the experiment networks. Second, the
larger networks can provide more opportunities to detour.
\iffalse
Last,
For IAC/IAC-NA and DC, more than
40\% of routers have more than one next hop in all simulated topologies.
and this advantage is more pronounced in large topologies.
From Fig. \ref{prreal}, Fig. \ref{prrocket} and Fig. \ref{prd}, we can see that INC, INC-NA and DC have the similar protection ratio, which have better performance than both of DMPA and TBFH.
\fi
\subsection{Network availability}
Since both of the above two metrics cannot accurately describe end-to-end network availability. Therefore, we will use network availability \cite{Geng2017Algebra} to measure the end-to-end availability of different algorithms in the next section.
\iffalse
 We formally define the network availability $A(G)$ as follows (similar to that in \cite{ReliabilityAnalysis}),
and use it as a main metric to evaluate the protection capability of different schemes.

The end-to-end availability of a source-destination ($s$-$d$) pair is defined as the
probability that the packets can be correctly forwarded from $s$ to $d$.
Assume that there exist $n$ different forwarding paths from $s$ to $d$,
the $i$-th which is denoted by $p_{i}(s,d)$.
We also use $P_{i}(s,d)$ to represent the set of links on the $p_{i}(s,d)$.
Further, let the event that $p_{i}(s,d)$ works be denoted by $A_{i}(s,d)$,
whose probability can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{ir}
P(A_{i})=\prod\limits_{\forall (m,n) \in P_{i}(s,d)}{r(m,n)}
\end{equation}


According to the Inclusion-Exclusion principle \cite{feller},
the end-to-end availability of a source-destination pair can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{asd}
A(s,d)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}{(-1)^{(k-1)}S_k}
\end{equation}
where $S_k$ denote the sum of the probabilities that a unique set of $k$ paths
from $s$ to $d$ are simultaneously working, which is further expressed as:

\begin{eqnarray}\label{sk}
S_{k}&=&\sum\limits_{i<j< \cdots <k}{P(A_{i} \cap A_{j}\cdots \cap A_{k})} \nonumber \\
&=&\sum\limits_{i<j< \cdots <k} \left(\prod\limits_{ (m,n) \in P_{i}(s,d) \cup P_{j}(s,d) \cup \dots \cup P_{k}(s,d)}{r(m,n)}\right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}


Then, the network availability can be computed as

\begin{equation}
A(G)=\frac{\sum\limits_{s,d \in V, s \neq d}{A(s,d)}}{|V|*(|V|-1|)}
\end{equation}

Fig. \ref{avdeg} illustrates the relationship between the network availability and the average node degree.
As Fig. \ref{avdeg} shows, as the average node degree increase, the network availability increases too. Note that when the average node degree increases, all schemes provide better protection results, while IAC/IAC-NA and DC are always much better than DMPA and TBFH.

Table \ref{Availability} provides the network availability provided by each protection scheme, on the real and measured topologies. From the results, we can see that IAC has a clear advantage over TBFH and DMPA, and has the same performance as Naive.

\subsection{Incremental Deployment}
In this paper, we have proposed IAC/IAC-NA,
which is compatible with nowadays link-state routing
protocol, such as OSPF and IS-IS.
ISPs can deploy the algorithm in two ways, full deployment and incremental deployment.
However, full deployment is a burden for all ISPs.
Therefore, incremental deployment is employed in practice.
In this section, we will address the incremental deployment problem.
A node-by-node incremental deployment scheme is highly preferred.
The optimal deployment can be defined as:\\
\textbf{Optimal Deployment:}
Given a graph $G(V,E)$ and a positive integer $k$, our objective is to find a deployment $M$ where, $M \subset V$ and $|M|$=$k$ such that network availability is maximized.
\iffalse
\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{GreedyDeploy($G, m$)}
\label{deployment1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $M\leftarrow \emptyset$
\WHILE {$|M|\leq k$}
\STATE $a\leftarrow max(B(a,M))$
\STATE $M\leftarrow M\cup \{a\}$
\ENDWHILE
\RETURN $S$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\fi

We first define a benefit function for a node with respect to
the nodes which have been deployed.
Let $a$ be an arbitrary node in the network.
The benefit of node $a$ with respect to $M$, which is the nodes have been already deployed, is
denoted by $B(a,M)$, which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}\label{benefit}
B(a,M)=A(G,M\cup \{a\})-A(G,M)
\end{equation}

It has been proved in \cite{zhang2013rpfp} that
finding the optimal deployment is NP-Complete.
Because the Optimal Deployment is NP-Complete problem.
With regard to the large $k$ and large topologies, a straight-forward
exhaustive search is computationally unacceptable.

\iffalse
A  simple greedy heuristic algorithm (GreedyDeploy)
 for selecting nodes to be deployed. The inputs of algorithm  is $k$.
The outputs of the algorithm  is the optimal deployment $M$.
The algorithm  goes through several iterations,
in each iteration, we will select a node which  has the maximum benefit to be deployed.
\fi

\iffalse
We propose an improved algorithm (SimulateDeploy) roughly modeled
after the Simulated Annealing probabilistic metaheuristic \cite{retvari2011optimizing}.
The main idea is that we first randomly select the deployed nodes set $M$.
Then finding the best $S'$
and accept it if either $S'$ can obtain lager network availability
than $S$ or  the temperature $T$ of the system is sufficiently large.
As the algorithm progresses we gradually
reduce $T$, thus the system will increasingly tend to get stuck
 in a local optimal solution.


We develop  Algorithm \ref{deployment} to solve the Optimal Deployment issue.
First, we randomly select a set of $M$, $M \subset V$ and $|M|$=$k$ , and set an initial system temperature (lines 1-2).
Let tuple $(c,c')$ be a pair of nodes such that  $c \in M$  and  $c' \notin M$,
we unconditionally accept this $c'$ either if it is
better than the previous one or if a random number generated temperature is less than $T$ (lines 4-5).
This can guarantee the algorithm escape from a local minimum.
\fi

\STATE $T\leftarrow T_0 $
\STATE generate the initial set $M$ randomly

\STATE $M\leftarrow (M-c) \cup c'$
\ELSE
\STATE $T\leftarrow T-1$
\ENDIF
\UNTIL{$T>T_{0}\land$ no such $(c,c')$ exists}
\RETURN $M$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We propose an improved approximate algorithm roughly modeled

The main idea is that we first select $M$, which is the solution generated randomly.
Then finding the best solutions
and accept it if either they can obtain lager network availability

As the algorithm progresses we gradually

in a good quality local minimum.
We develop  Algorithm \ref{deployment} to solve the Optimal Deployment issue.
The inputs of Algorithm \ref{deployment} is $k$.
The outputs of the Algorithm \ref{deployment} is the optimal deployment $M$.
First, we generate a set of $M$ for $M \subset V$ and $|M|$=$k$ randomly, and set an initial system temperature (lines 1-2).
Let tuple $(c,c')$ be a pair of nodes such that  $c \in M$  and  $c' \notin M$,
we unconditionally accept this $c'$ either if it is
better than the previous one or if a random number generated temperature is less than $T$ (lines 4-5).


Our proposed algorithm is compatible with the currently deployment intra-domain routing protocol.
In this section, we will show the relationship between the number of deployed nodes and network availability. In our experiment, we implement Algorithm \ref{deployment} respectively on real and generated topologies.
We repeated ten experiments, the final value for each topology is the average of the results.

Fig. \ref{abilene}, Fig. \ref{exodus}  and Fig. \ref{sprint} depict the relationship between the number of deployed nodes and network availability in  real networks and measured  topologies,
while Fig. \ref{top100avi} shows  the relationship between the number of deployed nodes and network availability in generated topology when the topology size is 1000.
Note that, as the node deployed ratios increases, the network availability increase too, our proposed algorithm can provide comparable performance to that of DC. Through this experiment, we will give ISPs a recommendation that they
can give priority to the deployment of some key nodes, and finally the whole network deployment.
In the actual deployment, we can give priority to the deployment of key nodes.
%We can also see that when a deployment on only 40\% nodes already increase the network availability clearly.
