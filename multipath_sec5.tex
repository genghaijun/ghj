\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
This paper is mainly focusing on the problem that how to efficiently
and effectively deploy LFA on ISPS' networks.
To this end, an incremental alternates computation with negative augmentation algorithm (IAC-NA) based on Incremental Shortest Path First
Algorithm was proposed.
Unlike majority of
schemes proposed in the literature, IAC-NA does not need to construct many SPTs on a node, which would entail significant computation overhead.
We also established the correctness of our scheme,
together with some other important properties. On top of that,
simulation results using several realistic network instances
gave evidence that IAC-NA  is very competitive in terms of
network availability as well.
The simulation results showed that IAC-NA can achieve
the same network availability as  the state-of-the-art LFA with small computation overhead.

In the future, we will focus on studying the link failure characteristics.
We believe that accurate link failure model will accurately improve  the performance evaluation.
We will use virtualization technology to deploy our algorithms on
CERNET2, which is the China Education and Research network.
