% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Both the hardware and the software of network equipments face occasional failures.
%Typical scenarios include that a fiber is broken, or a forwarding port is down, or even a router completely stops working.
Without proper failure mitigation methods, packets forwarded to the failed equipment are no longer able to
be correctly forwarded,
%so packet losses will be inevitable
and network performance will be degraded.
Although routing protocols automatically detect topology changes, heal the network by globally computing new paths, and reroute,
they typically exhibit a slow response of hundreds of milliseconds or even longer.
To support critical applications or guarantee a high quality of service, Internet Service Providers
generally deploy a technique called Loop Free Alternates for local fast rerouting or load balancing.
Alternate next hops are stored alongside with
the default next hops in a router's forwarding table, and can be immediately activated
to invoke a loop free repair path in face of link or node failures, or used for multipath transmission.
Existing algorithms for computing Loop Free Alternates
rely on one or more rounds of full shortest path tree computation on a graph,
and cannot achieve both good coverage of alternates and low computational complexity at the same time.
Based on some graph properties we newly find, we propose IAC-NA, which can
compute the full set of alternates based on incremental shortest path computation on an augmented graph.
Compared with the naive implementation in typical commercial routers, IAC-NA achieves the same coverage of alternates but
with at least an $O(k)$ reduction in both time and memory consumption, where $k$ is the degree of a node.
Compared with TBFH and DMPA, which are latest algorithms proposed for acceleration of computation,
IAC-NA not only achieves around $3 \sim 6$ times reduction in computation time
and finds xx times of available alternates in typical real-world topologies, but also
provides link and node protection capabilities that TBFH and DMPA cannot provide.
These advantages make IAC-NA a good candidate for large complex networks that require failure protection and load balancing
in a highly dynamic environment.

\iffalse
The computational overhead of some existing methods (denoted by LFA) is very large, and their computational complexity is linear with the average node degree of the network. Therefore, the current methods need to consume a large amount of CPU resources, aggravate the burden on the router, and they are not suitable for practical deployment in large-scale networks.
Some schemes, e.g. TBFH, have less computational overhead than LFA, however, the network availability of TBFH is lower than LFA.
Therefore, to improve the routing resilience without introducing significant extra overhead, this paper propose incremental alternates computation with negative augmentation algorithm (IAC-NA) based on Incremental Shortest Path First Algorithm.

a DC-based algorithm and a LFA-based algorithm  are proposed.
Both of them are based on Incremental Shortest Path First Algorithm.
They are respectively the incremental alternates computation algorithm (IAC) and incremental alternates computation with negative augmentation (IAC-NA).

IAC-NA  first turns the problem of quickly implementation of LFA into how to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of all its neighbors to all other nodes of the network on the shortest path tree rooted at the compute node. Then a theorem for calculating the cost is presented and its correctness is proved. Finally, we theoretically analyze the time complexity of the algorithm. The computational complexity of IAC-NA is independent of the average node degree of the network.

Experiments show that compared with LFA algorithm, IAC-NA not only has less computation overhead, but also provides the same network availability as LFA.

Lots of related researches have shown that network failures occur inevitably and frequently on the Internet. When network failures occur, the current deployed intra-domain routing protocol need to re-convergence. During the process of re-convergence, the packets may be lost due to inconsistent routing information, greatly reducing the network availability, seriously affecting the ISP¡¯s service quality and reputation. Therefore, improving the network availability has become an urgent problem.
The DC (Downstream Criterion) approach has been widely used by many internet service providers for coping with the single link failure scenario in large Internet backbones. However, the efficiency issue of the implementation of DC is not well addressed.
\fi
\iffalse
However, all of the existing algorithms concerning on the implementation of DC are time-consuming and require a large amount of router CPU resources.
 To improve the routing resilience without introducing
significant extra overhead, we propose an efficient Intra-domain routing protection algorithm based on i-SPF (ERPISPF). Theoretical analysis indicates that the time complexity of ERPISPF is less than that of constructing a shortest path tree. The experiment results show that ERPISPF reduce more than 93\% computation overhead compared to the DC, and can provide the same network availability with DC.\fi
